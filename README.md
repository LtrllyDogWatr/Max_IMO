# Basketball Hesis ("heh-zees")
This site is about how to do different hesis.
If you play basketball then you might want to know how to do a few hesis. Keep in mind that they will not work 100% of the time, but they are a nice skill to add to your bag/toolbox.

### This site I found online explains what hesis are and what they do - [The Hesi Move in Basketball](https://queenballers.club/basketball/hesi-move)

# Different Types of Hesis

## Hesi #1: Tween Hesi
To do this move, you have to cross the ball between you legs and delay your movement for a second. Then, you want to push the ball forward and then you can drive or make another move. The "rocking" of the hesitation/delay will trick the defender into thinking that you will go the other way and they will hop onto your other side in order to defend the move they think you are doing. This allows you to blow by them before they realize what you are doing and they will have trouble catching up to you. You can also combo this move by following it with a crossover or an in & out dribble to counter the defender if they have already seen you do the move.

## Hesi #2: Shot Fake Hesi

To do this move, you need to fake your shot and drop down the ball right when the defender jumps. You can put down the ball in different ways (do not put your hand under the ball while doing this or it will be a carry) such as: a crossover, in & out dribble, or behind the back. This will allow you to finish, dump it off to your big man, or make a move while you defender is delayed because they jumped. This is a strong move, as it is very convincing and will give you lots of space to make a move while the defender is jumping.
